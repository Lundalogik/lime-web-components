Components are built using [StencilJS](https://stenciljs.com/docs/introduction), which uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and [reactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) data-binding. A basic understanding of these concepts is required in order to follow along this documentation.
