## Prerequisites

To start developing Lime Web Components, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3
- node and npm
- lime-project

We recommend using the latest version of npm and lime-project, and the LTS version of node.

## Creating a new web component

To create a new web component you need a plugin created with `lime-project`. Once a plugin has been created, a new web component can be created by executing the following from the plugin root directory:

```sh
lime-project generate web-component <my-component>
```

where `<my-component>` is the name of the component.

## Starting the dev environment

Once a web component has been created, you can start the development by going to the `<plugin_module>/frontend` directory inside the plugin and running:

```sh
npm start
```

This command will create a development build of your web-component and watch for any changes in the `frontend` folder.
