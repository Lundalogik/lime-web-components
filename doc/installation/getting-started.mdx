## Prerequisites

To start developing Lime Web Components, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3
- node and npm
- lime-project

We recommend using the latest version of npm and lime-project, and the LTS version of node.

## Creating a new web component

To create a new web component you need a plugin created with `lime-project`. Once a plugin has been created, a new web component can be created by executing the following from the plugin root directory:

```sh
lime-project generate web-component <my-component>
```

where `<my-component>` is the name of the component.

## Starting the dev environment

Once a web component has been created, the dev environment can be started by going to the `<plugin_module>/web_components/lwc-components` directory inside the plugin and running:

```sh
npm start
```

After the environment has started, a preview of the generated web component can be found at http://localhost:3000
