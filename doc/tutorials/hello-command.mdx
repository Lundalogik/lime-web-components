# Hello, Command!

This guide will show how to generate a new command, connect it to a handler, and trigger the command from a menu in the
webclient.

## Generate a command

The module needs the translation module to exist. In case you don't have that yet in your plugin, run this command inside your project

```
lime-project generate translation-module
```

Afterwards you can generate a new command

```
lime-project generate command hello
```

This will generate a command class and its corresponding handler.

```typescript
// src/commands/hello/hello.command.ts
import { Command } from "@limetech/lime-web-components-interfaces";

@Command({
    id: "my-plugin.hello"
})
export class HelloCommand {}
```

```typescript
// src/commands/hello/hello.handler.ts
import { CommandHandler } from "@limetech/lime-web-components-interfaces";

export class HelloHandler implements CommandHandler {
    public handle(command: HelloCommand) {

    }
}
```

## Implement the handler

Our command is only going to show a notification when the command is handled, but a more common use case when it is
triggered from a menu is probably to open a dialog.

To be able to show a notification when executing the command, we need to inject the `notifications` service in the
constructor of the handler, and then use the service in the `handle` method when the command is executed.


```typescript
import { CommandHandler, NotificationService } from "@limetech/lime-web-components-interfaces";

export class HelloHandler implements CommandHandler {
    constructor(private notifications: NotificationService) {}

    public handle(command: HelloCommand) {
        this.notifications.notify('Running HelloCommand!');
        console.log(command);
    }
}
```

## Register the command

In order to run this command, we need to register it with the handler when the application starts. A good place to do
this is in the `Loader` component that is generated together with the first web component. In the `componentWillLoad`
lifecycle hook, we can add the code that registers our command and make it useable in the application.

```typescript
// src/components/lwc-my-plugin-loader/lwc-my-plugin-loader.tsx
export class Loader implements LimePluginLoader {
    public componentWillLoad() {
        const helloHandler = new HelloHandler(this.platform.notifications);
        this.platform.commandBus.register(HelloCommand, helloHandler);
    }
}
```

## Trigger the command

To trigger the command by yourself, you can simply send it to the commandbus from a component, e.g.

```typescript
function onButtonClick() {
    const command = new HelloCommand();
    this.platform.commandbus.handle(command);
}
```

However, in order to add it to an menu in the webclient, we need to configure the menu to list our command.

```json
{
    "actions": [{
        "id": "my-plugin.hello"
    }]
}
```
This can be either the configuration to your own plugin where you then also need to provide the corresponding menu in a web-component
or the action menu on a table-view. For the latter option add the `actions` json snippet to the table configuration in lime-admin
for every limetype the command should be available for.
