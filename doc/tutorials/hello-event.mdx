# Hello, Event!

This guide illustrates how to replace the dialog when creating a new Limeobject with a custom one.

## Generate a new component

First, we need to generate a new web component with `lime-project` that will hold the new dialog we want to be
displayed instead of the original one.

```bash
lime-project generate web-component custom-dialog
```

The custom dialog will require some new functionality to replace the one in the default dialog. However, this is out of
scope for this guide and we will only render a message. Feel free to add something more interesting!

```typescript
@Component({
    tag: 'lwc-my-plugin-custom-dialog',
    shadow: true,
})
export class CustomDialog implements LimeWebComponent {
    public render() {
        return (
            <limel-dialog open={true} onClose={this.handleClose}>
                <h1>My custom dialog!</h1>
            </limel-dialog>
        );
    }

    private handleClose = () => {}
}
```

## Listen for command events

To prevent the default dialog from appearing when a new Limeobject is created, we need to listen for the
`command.received` event and check if it is a `CreateLimeobjectDialogCommand` that is being handled. This should be
done in the loader component that is generated automatically.

```typescript
export class Loader implements LimePluginLoader {
    public constructor() {
        this.handleCommandReceived = this.handleCommandReceived.bind(this);
    }

    public componentWillLoad() {
        this.platform.eventDispatcher.addListener(
            CommandEvent.Received,
            this.handleCommandReceived
        );
    }

    private handleCommandReceived(event: CustomEvent) {}
}
```

Now, `handleCommandReceived` will be invoked each time a command is being handled by the commandbus. We should now
check for the command we are interested in, prevent the default action from happening and instead display the custom
dialog. We can also add other checks, maybe we only want to handle a specific limetype.

```typescript
private handleCommandReceived(event: CustomEvent) {
    const command = event.detail.command;
    if (getCommandId(command) !== getCommandId(CreateLimeobjectDialogCommand)) {
        return;
    }

    if (command.limetype.name !== 'deal') {
        return;
    }

    event.preventDefault();
    this.platform.dialog.create('lwc-my-plugin-custom-dialog');
}
```

Now we have successfully added a custom dialog that will be displayed instead of the default one every time a new deal
is created!


## Trigger the original command

Another use case might be to display our custom dialog, and after that display the original populated with some data
gathered from our first one. To do this, we need to dispatch the original command again but also add a flag to it so we
know not to interrupt it once it reaches our event handler.

```typescript
private handleCommandReceived(event: CustomEvent) {
    ...
    // Check if our custom flag has been set, if so don't do anything
    if (command['_useOriginalHandler']) {
        return;
    }

    // Set our custom flag so we don't handle this command again
    command['_useOriginalHandler'] = true;

    event.preventDefault();
    this.platform.dialog.create('lwc-my-plugin-custom-dialog', { command });
}
```

And in our dialog component, we can dispatch it once again

```typescript
export class CustomDialog implements LimeWebComponent {
    @Prop()
    public command: CreateLimeobjectDialogCommand;

    private handleClose = () => {}
        // Add custom data to display in the original dialog
        this.command.limeobject = {
            name: 'The one big deal!'
        };

        // Handle the original command again
        this.platform.commandbus.handle(this.command);
    }
}
```

Now the custom dialog will be displayed everytime a new deal is created, and when the dialog closes it will open the
original one instead, but populated with our custom data!
