# Hello, world!

This guide aims to provide a basic setup, create a simple web component and display it on the object card.

## Creating a plugin

To get started, run `lime-project` to create a new plugin

```sh
lime-project new plugin
```

It can be named anything, but in this guide we are sticking to the default and naming it `My Plugin`.

## Generating a web component

Enter the plugin directory and generate a new web component:

```sh
cd my-plugin
lime-project generate web-component hello-world
```

When the first component is created, some project setup is needed which might take a while to complete.

## Rendering the component

Once the setup is complete, we can change directory to the root directory of the web components, and start our favorite editor.

```sh
cd my_plugin/web_components/lwc-components
code .
```

Our hello-world component is located in `src/components/lwc-my-plugin-hello-world/lwc-my-plugin-hello-world.tsx`. The file contains a lot of auto generated code that is useful, but not required for our simple hello-world component. We can remove most of it, but we have to keep the properties that belong to the `LimeWebComponent` interface, along with the `render` method.

The finished component should look something like this:

```tsx
import { Component, Element, Prop } from '@stencil/core';
import { LimeWebComponent, LimeWebComponentContext, LimeWebComponentPlatform } from '@limetech/lime-web-components-interfaces';

@Component({
    tag: 'lwc-my-plugin-hello-world',
    shadow: true
})
export class HelloWorld implements LimeWebComponent {
    @Prop()
    public platform: LimeWebComponentPlatform;

    @Prop()
    public context: LimeWebComponentContext;

    @Element()
    public element: HTMLElement;

    public render() {
        return 'Hello, world!';
    }
}
```

We can now start the development environment by executing the following from the console.

```
npm start
```

Once the server has started, we can visit `http://localhost:3000/lwc-my-plugin-hello-world` and see the component render itself.

## Configuring a slot

To add this component to the object card, all we need to do is edit `lwc.config.json` and add our desired slot.

```json
[
    {
        "name": "lwc-my-plugin-hello-world",
        "slot": "object.card.head.panels"
    }
]
```


## Installing the plugin

We are now ready to install our plugin in the webclient. Change directory to the root directory of the plugin, and install the plugin with `limeplug`

```sh
cd my-plugin
limeplug install .
```

Once the webserver has been restarted, we should see our hello-world component render itself in the object card header.
