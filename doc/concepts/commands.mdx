# Commands

Commands are a great way to help capture user intent. They let us encapsulate all information needed to perform an
action into an object, and later execute that action without knowing anything about the action beeing requested or the
receiver of the request.

To help with this, the platform exposes a service called `commandbus`.

## Command bus

The command bus uses the command design pattern and combines it with a service layer. Its job is to take a command
object (which describes what the user wants to do) and match it to a handler (which executes it). This can help you
structure your code in a neat way.

We can for instance use it in a menu. The menu knows nothing about what actions to perform when the user selects an
item in the menu. It only takes command objects as input, and sends the commands to the command bus for execution when
an item is selected.

### Example
First we declare and register the command and its handler on the command bus

```typescript
@Command({ id: 'my-special-command' })
class MySpecialCommand {
    public id: number;
    public limetype: Limetype;
}

class MySpecialHandler implements CommandHandler {
    public handle(command: MySpecialCommand) {
        // do your magic stuff here
    }
}

const handler = new MySpecialHandler();
platform.commandbus.register(MySpecialCommand, handler);
```

Then, if we want to invoke the command, we simply create an instance of it and send it to the commandbus

```typescript
const command = new MySpecialCommand();
command.id = 1001;
command.limetype = { ... };

platform.commandbus.handle(command);
```
