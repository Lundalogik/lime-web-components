# State

The state in the webclient stores all information related to data. It can be limetypes, loaded limeobjects, the current
user etc.

## Connecting to the state

To use the state, a property in a web component must be connected to it. This is done by decorating the property with
the `@Connect` decorator and specifying what to connect to. The example below shows how to connect to the state to get
the current logged in user.

```tsx
export class MyComponent implements LimeWebComponent {

    @Connect(StateSelector.CurrentUser)
    @Prop()
    public user: object;

    public render() {
        return <p>Hello {this.user.fullname}!</p>;
    }
}
```

## Filtering the result with arguments

It's also possible to send arguments into the `@Connect` decorator in order to make it more specific. The following
example will load all loaded limeobjects into the connected property.

```tsx
export class MyComponent implements LimeWebComponent {

    @Connect(StateSelector.Limeobjects)
    @Prop()
    public limeobjects: object;
}
```

If we only want objects of a specific limetype, we can specify that limetype when decorating the property. The
following will give us all currenyly loaded persons

```tsx
export class MyComponent implements LimeWebComponent {

    @Connect(StateSelector.Limeobjects, {
        arguments: ['person']
    })
    @Prop()
    public persons = [];
}
```

## Using a mapping function

While this is useful, it can be made even more useful if combined with a mapping function. Let's say we have a web
component that is displayed on the company card, and we want a list of all persons connected to that company. First, we
can define a filtering function that filters out our persons like this:

```js
function currentPersons(persons = []) {
    return persons.filter(person => person.company === this.context.id);
}
```

This function takes a list of persons, and returns a new list which only contains persons of the company in the current
context.

We can apply this filtering function by specifying it when decorating our property.

```tsx
export class MyComponent implements LimeWebComponent {

    @Connect(StateSelector.Limeobjects, {
        arguments: ['person'],
        map: [currentPersons]
    })
    @Prop()
    public persons = [];
}
```

This will map the original result (a list of all persons) to a new result (a filtered list of persons) that is stored
in the connected property.

This is an easy way to get the limeobject of the current context, and there is an exported function from the
`lime-web-component-interfaces` package that does this so there is no need to write it each time.

```tsx
import { currentLimeobject } from 'lime-web-component-interfaces';

export class MyComponent implements LimeWebComponent {

    @Connect(StateSelector.Limeobjects, {
        map: [currentLimeobject]
    })
    @Prop()
    public limeobject: object;
}
```
