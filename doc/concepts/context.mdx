# Context

The context property on `LimeWebComponent` contains the context the component belongs to. This context depends on where
the component lives. For most cases, it will just contain a `limetype` and an `id`, but in some cases there might not
be any context information available. It's the responsibility of the webclient to pass a valid context to the web
component.
